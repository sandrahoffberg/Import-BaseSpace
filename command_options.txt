    Filesystem Options:
          --extension=                    List of file extensions to filter by
          --overwrite                     overwrite files that already exist and have the same file size
      -o, --output=                       output directory (defaults to current working directory) or filename for compressed output (defaults to archive.tar.gz) (default: .)

    File Filtering:
          --include=                      Patterns to include files in the transfer in order (can be supplied more than once). By default all files are included so must be used with
                                          --exclude to have an effect, for example: --exclude '*' --include '*.csv' would include only files with a .csv extension in the transfer.
          --exclude=                      Patterns to exclude files from the transfer in order (can be supplied more than once). Ordering of --include and --exclude flags is
                                          important, for example --include 'NA12878*' --exclude '*' will exclude everything because the exclusion is applied last, whereas reversing
                                          the order of these flags selectively includes only files starting with NA12878.

    Concurrency Options:
          --concurrency=[low|medium|high] Set upload concurrency level. Higher levels of concurrency may be faster but may also saturate internet bandwidth (default: medium)
          --concurrent-files=             Maximum number of files to process concurrently, use together with concurrent-parts to override --concurrency
          --concurrent-parts=             Maximum number of parts per file to process concurrently, use together with concurrent-files to override --concurrency
